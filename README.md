# Video_Processing_Application
# 1. Introduction
# Purpose of the Application
The Video Processing Application is designed to process video streams from multiple sources, extract frames, perform batch processing, and store relevant data in a database. This application is useful for various purposes such as surveillance, data analysis, and more.
# Key Features
•	Ingest video streams from multiple cameras simultaneously.<br>
•	Extract frames from the video streams and save them as image files.<br>
•	Create batches of frames based on the specified duration.<br>
•	Store batch information in a MySQL database.<br>
•	Handle errors gracefully and log relevant information for debugging.<br>
•	Achieve concurrent processing of frames from different cameras for improved performance.<br>
# 2. System Requirements
# Hardware Requirements
•	Modern computer i3 5th generation and above with sufficient CPU and RAM.<br>
•	One or more cameras or video sources.<br>
•	Adequate storage space for saving frames and data.<br>
# Software Requirements
•	Operating System: Windows, Linux, or macOS.<br>
•	Python 3.x installed.<br>
•	Required Python packages: OpenCV, json, mysql.connector, logging, multiprocessing.<br>
# 3. Getting Started
# Installation
1.	Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2.	Install the required Python packages using pip:<br>
   pip install opencv-python json mysql-connector-python logging 
# Configuration
1.	Modify the video_file_paths list to include the paths to your video streams.
2.	Adjust other configuration parameters as needed, such as database credentials and duration.
# 4. Using the Application
# Video Stream Ingestion
•	The application can ingest video streams from multiple cameras simultaneously.<br>
•	Add the paths to your video streams in the video_file_paths list in the configuration.<br>
# Frame Processing
•	Frames are extracted from the video streams and saved as image files.<br>
•	One frame per second is saved as an image.<br>
•	Frame information, including camera ID and image path, is logged to a JSON file.<br>
# Batching
•	Batches of frames are created based on the specified duration in the configuration.<br>
•	Each batch includes information such as batch ID, starting frame ID, ending frame ID, and a timestamp.<br>
•	Batch information is stored in a MySQL database.
# Data Storage
•	The application stores batch information in a MySQL database.<br>
•	A table named "batches" is created to store this information.<br>
•	Batch data includes batch ID, starting frame ID, ending frame ID, and a timestamp.<br>
# 5. Error Handling and Logging
•	The application includes error handling mechanisms to capture and handle exceptions.<br>
•	Errors are logged in an "error.log" file, including details about the error and the frame or batch causing the error.<br>
•	Logging helps in debugging and troubleshooting issues.<br>
# 6. Concurrency and Performance
•	The application is designed to achieve concurrent processing of frames from different cameras.<br>
•	It uses the multiprocessing library to create a pool of processes, one for each camera stream.<br>
•	Concurrent processing improves the performance of the application.<br>
# 7. Documentation and Comments
•	The code is well-documented with comments that explain the purpose and functionality of key functions and classes.<br>
•	This documentation helps developers understand and maintain the code.<br>
# 8. Conclusion
The Video Processing Application is a powerful tool for processing video streams, extracting frames, and storing batch information in a database. It offers flexibility, error handling, and concurrent processing to meet various use cases. With proper configuration and usage, it can be a valuable asset for tasks such as surveillance, data analysis, and more.
